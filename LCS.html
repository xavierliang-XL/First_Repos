                    Cloud9, the returning LCS hope.
                    Of course, Cloud9 are back at Worlds. They’re the NA standard bearer and have only missed one world championship since 2013. Despite a rocky spring split, C9 blew up everybody’s predictions in beating Evil Geniuses in the 
                    LCS playoffs to claim their spot at Worlds and ultimately winning the LCS Championship with a dominant 3-0 over 100 Thieves. Ibrahim "Fudge" Allami is back in the top lane after a brief experiment playing in the mid lane, 
                    and Zven has role swapped to support in order to allow LCS rookie Berserker to shine as the team’s AD carry. Oh, and Jensen is back after a brief retirement to stabilize 
                    the mid lane. They might have been overlooked this LCS season, but nobody will be underestimating them at Worlds.

                    100 Thieves, the newly emerging LCS power house.
                    It’s unusual in esports for teams to keep the same roster from one year to the next, and it’s even more rare for a team to maintain a high level of success with the same roster year over year. That’s exactly what 100 Thieves 
                    has done in qualifying for Worlds in back-to-back years with Ssumday, Closer, Abbedagge, FBI and huhi. They did about as well as can be expected of an 
                    NA team last year in winning a few group games. However, they had been distributed to a group that included both the LPL legend and LCK legend teams, they weren't able to head to the knockout stage.
                    The question is can they take the next step and reach the knockout stage this year in front of North American crowds in New York?

                    Evil Geniuses, the Spring Split champion.
                    EG are following up their first-ever Mid-Season Invitational appearance with their first-ever trip to Worlds. The North American spring champions beat Team Liquid in the LCS summer playoffs to secure NA’s third spot at the world 
                    championship. With NA hosting Worlds this year, Evil Geniuses are set to showcase some homegrown NA talent, including the brash jojopyun and the ration king himself Vulcan. It's unclear if 
                    the team's other homegrown star, AD carry Danny, will be at Worlds as he is taking a mental health break. EG's worlds journy may be challenging, as by the time I am creating this website, they've already lost to MAD in the Play-in stage.
