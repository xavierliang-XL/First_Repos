                    JingDong Gaming, first showed up in worlds in 2020 as the second seed of LPL. Lost to SN which was the third seed of the LPL in quarterfinals.
                    In 2022, they recruited 369 from Top Esports, Hope from Edward Gaming and Missing from WE. Successfully defeated TES in the finals and claimed their first LPL Summer Split Title.
                    JDG is best known for their discipline, the team is well led by their coach Homme that they seldom make mistakes especially in the playoffs.
                    They are considered as a team that "does not own a superstar" but somehow grow to a super team by their incredible chemical reactions.

                    Top Esports, a super team that rised up in 2020. The team remains competitve in recent years. 
                    TES went into the worlds for the first time in their franchise history as the 1st seed of LPL in 2020. Alike to JDG, TES also lost to SN in the semifinals.
                    In Spring 2022, TES had been through a struggle with their roster, they traded their top laner 369 for JDG's super star top laner Zoom. However, it quickly turned out that Zoom wasn't an ideal top laner for Top Esports.
                    Luckily TES was able to recruit the rookie top laner Wayward, who eventually turned out to perform better and become TES's starting top laner in s12.
                    The team TES is built based on their two supercarries, Jackeylove and Knight. The two are considered to be one of the best duo carries of all time.
                    TES also recruited the 2019 worlds finals mvp jungler Tian, who is considered to be the top 1 jungler in 2022.

                    Edward Gaming, the defending champion. EDG reached their peak year in 2021, they headed into the semifinals
                    when there are three LCK teams and 1 LPL team remaining, and EDG was the most underrated team among the 4 teams.
                    They ended their season perfectly by defeating the S7(year 2017) champion GenG and the S10(year 2020) champion Damwong Kia.
                    EDG keeps its championship roster this year, and looks forward to defending their title.

                    Royal Never Give Up, the MSI champion of 2022. After their legendary AD Carry Uzi's retirement, it took RNG a few years to get back to the list of super teams in LPL.
                    This year, RNG absolutely dominated the Spring Split, they had defeated the past LCK emperor T1 in MSI finals. However, RNG struggled hard in the Summer Split.
                    They first lost Bin, who was the top laner who helped them win the MSI. Then they lost in the first round in playoffs and 
                    lost to EDG in the S12 Worlds Qualified Series. Fortunately, they were able to qualify as the 4th seed of LPL 
                    by beating LNG in the second round of qualifying series.
