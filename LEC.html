                    Rogue, the new LEC champion.
                    Rogue are going to Worlds for the third consecutive season, and for the first time are champions of Europe.  In 2021, RGE was eliminated by FPX which was the LPL second seed in group stage.
                    Although G2 and Fnatic have typically been the European heavyweights, 
                    Rogue have emerged as a counterweight to those two teams. Despite losing jungler Kacper "Inspired" Słoma and bot laner Steven "Hans sama" Liv to NA teams last offseason, Rogue 
                    replaced them with the new top laner Malrang and ad carry Comp and haven’t lost a beat. After winning their first LEC title, reaching the knockout stage 
                    at Worlds would be the next big step for this org.

                    G2, the power house of Europe. After missing the League of Legends World Championship last year, G2 are back. They finished in the top four every year from 2018 to 2020, highlighted by a runner-up finish at Worlds 2019. 
                    The superstar mid laner caPs and jungler Jankos are still at the core of this team along with a young bot lane duo and solid top laner "topfather" Broken Blade. They were the champions of 
                    Europe in the spring and reached the semifinals of the Mid-Season Invitational(MSI). When G2 are at their best, they’re one of the best teams in the world.

                    Fnatic, the S1 champion once again return to the worlds.
                    Fnatic continue to set the bar for League of Legends Worlds appearances. They have qualified for their 10th world championship, more than any other esports org. They had a rockier summer than spring, but they beat Misfits in 
                    the LEC summer playoffs to secure EU’s fourth and final spot at Worlds. All of the players on this roster have been to the world championship with Fnatic or another team except Razork, who will be making his Worlds debut.

                    Mad Lions, the "chosen" one.
                    Like Rogue, MAD Lions have emerged as one of the stronger and most consistent European teams in recent years. They are going to the world championship for the third straight year. Norman "Kaiser" Kaiser is the elder statesman 
                    on this team, having been with MAD Lions for both of the team’s previous Worlds runs, but Elyoya and Armut also bring plenty of experience from last year. Nisqy might 
                    be a newcomer to the team but he’s a League of Legends veteran with two Worlds appearances with other teams on his resume. The only youngster on this team is UNF0RGIVEN who made his LEC debut this year.
                    MAD Lion ridiculously went into worlds without winning a single Best of 5 serie. MAD Lion has the luck to get into worlds by one wild card region's absence.
                    Their ability to win in series still need to be proved.
