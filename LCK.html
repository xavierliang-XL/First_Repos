                    Generation Gaming, the LCK champion. before season 12, GenG was already one of the most competitve super teams in the world.
                    In 2021, they ended their season by losing to the former champion, EDG. This season, GenG had made some significant changes to secure their
                    dominance in worlds. Mid laner BDD was changed to Chovy, who was considered to be the best mid laner in season 2022. Under the cooperation between the
                    two best carries in LCK history, Chovy and Ruler, GenG was able to win the LCK title this summer and is now ambitious to the worlds championship.

                    SK Telecom T1, a name that would frighten almost all pro player in the world. In the past, T1 had won 3 worlds championships
                    with 2 titles in a row from S5~S6. T1's success is greatly contributed by its mid laner, the man that is regarded as the best league of legends player who had ever lived, Faker.
                    Faker started his career in T1 since 2013, in 2022, the unkillable demon king is back with his new star teammates. T1's roster is considered to be the roster that has the most depth.
                    T1 dominated the LCK in the Sprin Split but ended up with losing to RNG in MSI. Unlike to RNG, T1 was able to maintain their great performance in the Summer. They made to the finals again,
                    regretfully lost to GenG. No need to say, T1 is one of the most potential team to win the worlds.

                   Damwon Kia, the last LCK emperor. In recent years, where the worlds was completely in charge of the LPL, DK was able to stood out in S10 to win a title for the LCK.
                   DK remained unstoppable in 2021, they went into both the MSI finals and the Worlds finals but lost both. DK's glory was established on their mid and jungler duo, showmaker and
                   canyon, the two never leave DK throughout their careers. In 2022 Summer split, DK was able to get back their top laner in S10, Nuguri. This recruitment doubtlessly increased their chance
                   of winning the title.

                    Dragon X, the past LCK King. DRX was used to name "King Zone", KZ was used to be one of the most dominant super team in LCK history. However, their dominance were smashed by
                    Uzi and RNG in 2018 MSI. After 2018, KZ changed the name as "DRX". Unfortunately, DRX wasn't able to win any titles after that year, even with Deft and Chovy's joining in 2021.
                    The team was defeated by DK in quarterfinals. DRX lost their superstar mid laner Chovy this season, yet was still able to qualify as the fourth seed of the LCK by the incredible performance
                    of Deft in Qualifying series. DRX's potential in Worlds is so far, still in doubt.
